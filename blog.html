        <h1>Why Not Me!!!!!!</h1>
        <p>
             A tall and lean young man with black hair,black eyes,and brown complexion,a queit and moddest boy ,who is not good at making friends and would rather keep his distance,
             but possesses unrivalry intelligence and incredible physical ability.He is considered to be very handsome amongst the first-year boys,
             this is somewhat confirmed as he has attracted the attention of many girls in his class ,some of whom are even very popular.
             He is somewhat socially awkward, as he is terrible at communication with people and fails at correctly associating with them .
             As a result,he speaks in vey montonous way a tends to isolate himself from hios peers,not getting involved with socially activities.
             These traits tend to leave an impression on others that he is cunning,uncaring,breezy,and carefree,while also hinting at aloofness,latency,or generally a sense of apathy towards anything besides issues that specifically concern him.
             That is why some people in his classs still finds him to be and enigmatic presence despite having  been with him for over a years an inconspicuous and unobtrusive student,and while his grades are avreage ,
             he possesses a sagacious ability to read emotions of people around him with pinpoint accuracy and either helps or destroys them.Despite his apperent lazinedd and lack of intrest about everything and everyone .
            He does not like drawing attention to himself as after purchasing answers from old conversation.
            He appears not to enjoy showing off his talents,which was the main reasson for concealing himself from unwarrented attention.Its because he does so to prove that he can do something without revealing what he is truly capable of .
